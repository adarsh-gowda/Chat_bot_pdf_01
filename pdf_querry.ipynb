The rapid \\ndevelopm ents in telecommunications ov er the past tw enty years have been an \\nessential co mponent i n the growth of com puter-based  librar y and i nform ation \\nsystems and services. 38 \\n  \\nTelecom municat ion : Basics It would not have been possible to reali se and i mplement sy stems and services like \\nVideotex, Teletext, CATV,  Electronic directory , Electronic m ail, tel econferencin g, \\ndocum ent pre paration and transfer, datab ase handling, VANS/LA NS, etc. without the aid \\nof teleco mmunications. Also, the com paratively  cheap and easy  way by  which large \\ncollections of biblio graphic  data on a var iety of com puter sy stems through out the world \\ncan be passed  on to or accessed fro m a terminal in a library  or information centre  would \\nnot have been , possible but for the rapid developm ents in telecommunications. \\n39  \\n \\nSince all thes e aspect s have beco me part of com puter -based library and inform ation \\nsystems and services, it is necessary  that an inform ation professional should have a basic \\nknowledge of  recent innovations in telecomm unications which involve the use of novel \\ntransm ission media, increased co mputer control of  networks and sp ecific provision for \\ndata co mmunications. All these provide\\' faster, che aper, and m ore reliable trans mission \\nof large am ounts of data over both short  and long dist ances. The integration of el ectronic \\nmail services means that th ey can all be accessed from  one ter minal, either through t he \\nuse of specific hardware su ch as telex or fax boards, or  via \\' protocol conversions. Similar \\ntype of integration is being seen with online search s ervices also. This Unit is intended to \\nprovide telecommunications basics with the objectiv e of im partin g elem entary  \\nknowledge of  the subject to  the participants of BLIS P rogramme. The Unit is int ended to \\nbe a primer in this regard. \\n3.2 BASIC CONCEPTS AND TERMI NOLOGY \\nIn order to understand specific teleco mmuni cations technolo gies and  their current or \\npotential applications, in libr aries and information ser vices, we nee d to understand basic \\nconcepts and ter minology  in teleco mmunications. It is assu med that the participants of \\nBLIS programme of IGNOU have no p rior knowle dge of the subj ect. Hence, some of the \\nelementary  concepts and ter minology  are discussed i n this section to provide the m the \\nnecess ary backdrop. \\n3.2.1 Teleco mmun ications; Definitions \\n`Data co mmu nications\\' , `Communications t echnolog y\\', `Co mputer teleco mmunications\\' , \\nCompunications\\' , `Teleco mputing\\' , etc., are just  some of the terms we co me across in our \\n\\'current literature on the subject. Most of these te rms are used to describe a process, that of \\ntransm itting a message from  one point to another by electronic means, and the devices \\nused to achieve this process. The process is  well known and we engage in this process \\ndaily as we s peak to one a nother. We call this the communications process. Therefore, \\n\"Teleco mmunications may be defined as the trans mission of representations of \\ninform ation between re mote locations by electr onic means. This information may be in the \\nform  of Voice, Video, or d ata gene rated by, a com puter\". (Kenney , 1981) \\nWhen we use the telephone to talk with each other, we engage in a teleco mmunications \\nprocess. We use the telephone instrum ent (which  might be characterised as a t erminal) to \\nenter our m essage (data) fo r trans mission to anot her point; at the de stination, another \\nterminal is us ed to receive our m essage and return one if needed. The two ter minals are \\nconnected by  an electronic co mmunicati ons ch annel \\'or link, which serves to carr y the \\nmessage fro m point A to point B and bac k again. A teleco mmunication process, thus \\nconsists of data to be tr ansmitted (our messages), devices called ter minals to send and \\nreceive messages, and a communications channel (se e the fig.). \\n \\nIn ease many  messages are being sent and received at any  one tim e between many \\ndifferent points; switching mechanis ms are n eeded to ensure that all mess ages ar rive \\nas quickl y as possible, without bottle neck s encountered along t he way . For an easy \\nunderstandin g of this co ncept, we can com pare this message traffic to cit y traffic, \\nflowing in m any direction s and controll ed by traffic lights which allow onl y a certain \\nnumber of vehicles to m ove in a given d irection at any one tim e. Telephone m essages \\nare sim ilar to vehicles; both  have definite \\n  \\nInformation Technolog y: points of origin and destina tion and we can think of the system  of traffic lights as \\nswitching me chanis ms, to per mit vehicles to move as  quickly  as possible to their \\ndestination. We speak of traffic networ ks, and sim ilarly, we speak of \\nteleco mmunications networks. \\n40 Concept  and Basics \\n \\n \\n\"A teleco mmunications network, at its sim plest, may be regarded as co mprising a \\ntransm ission network, an arrangem ent of trans mission paths and s witching centres \\nthroug h whic h signals are conve yed by a physical transm ission medium . Information \\ncoming from  a source, or to a receiver, is converted via a ter minal i nto signals \\nappropriate to the character istics of the pa rticular network\". (Bawden and Blakeman). \\nFor exam ple, in the standard voice telephone network  system , the changes in air \\npressure at the microphone are represented by  a correspondi ng variation in electrical \\nvoltage. This is an exa mple of an analogue signal. In contrast, co mputer sy stem s \\ngenerate digital signals, which are represen ted as one of two discrete states, na mely \\non or off (1 or 0). Other sections of this Unit will be devoted for a brief description \\nand discussion of the process of data trans mission, communication channels, \\ntrans mission media, swit ching m echanis ms, terminals and networks - all of which \\nform  the basic co mponents of teleco mmunications. \\nSelf Check E xercise \\nl) Explain briefly the concept of “teleco mmunications” \\n2) Describe the functional co mponents of a teleco mmu nication network. \\nNote:  i) Write your answer in the space given below \\nii) Check your answer with  the answers given at the e nd of this Unit. \\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …… \\n3.3 DATA TRANSMI SSION \\nWhen we talk on the telephone we genera lly transm it a message to someone els e. The \\nmessage is made up of wor ds that we speak into the t elephone inst rument. The \\nhuman voice causes sound to be form ed into words; t hese sounds ar e transm itted in \\nthe form  of acoustical wav e patterns into the telephone instrum ent where they  are \\ntranslated into electronic wave patterns. These wave patterns are tr ansm itted over a \\nchannel to th eir destination where they  are converted back into so und waves received \\nby the hum an ear. It may be mentioned that all electro nic trans mission takes place by \\nmeans of wav e patterns. There are t wo majo r patterns. They  are analog and digital. \\n3.3.1  Analog Tran smission \\nIn analog trans mission, there is a continu ous up an d down pattern. For exam ple, one \\nwave constitutes one cy cle, which is meas ured in the unit called Hertz (cy cle per \\nsecond), the term s cycle and hertz may  be used inter-changeabl y. Thus, it is \\ncusto mary to describe chan nels as transmitting a certain num ber of cy cles per second \\n(cps). \\n3.3.2  Digital Transm ission \\nIn digital trans mission, wave patterns are translated i nto discrete bits and are \\nseparated by  intervals. Bits (contraction fo r binar y digits) are the smallest unit of \\ninform ation in data processing. The y may be com pared to a light-bulb, which is \\neither on or o ff. When the bulb is o n, information is being transm itted; when it is off, \\nthere is a blank or interval. In the figure, the upper line  of the rectangular wave form  \\nrepresents the  bits. The low er line denotes the interval between bits. At this juncture, \\nit must be noted that all electronic transmission \\n  \\nTelecom municat ion : Basics can occur in either the analog or t he digi tal mode. The telephone ne twork, origi nally \\nintended to c arry only the hum an voice, operates mostly in t he analog m ode, although  \\nall-digital transm ission is now available as well. Digi tal transm ission has the \\nadvantage of being entirel y com patible with com puter and term inal originated \\nmessages, wh ich also operate in digita l mode, and of  having the capabilit y of \\ntransm itting messages more accurat ely than the analog m ode. \\n41  \\n \\n \\n3.3.3 Frequency and Bandwidth \\nLet us try to understand a little about how information is transm itted. The \\ninform ation may  be in t he form  of sound (hum an voice, music) or it may  be vis ual \\n(printed page,  microfilm , video picture) o r it may  be di gital data. Whatever may be \\nthe form , it must be conver ted to electrica l signals (electro magnetic waves) before it \\ncan be transmitted over a gi ven m edium. Such  signals very  often cannot be sent over \\na channel as they  are, b ut must be modulated in some way  to fit t hem into the \\ncarry ing m edium . The freq uencies of the electro magnetic wave s are normally  radio \\nfrequendies which range from  low freq uencies capab le of carry ing only  small \\namounts of information to millim eter wav es, which can carry  very l arge am ounts. \\nAbove the radio frequenci es lies light freque ncy, which can be modulated to carry  \\neven larger am ounts of information. In other words, t he am ount of inform ation that \\ncan be sent over a given channel in a gi ven tim e is dependent o n the bandwidth. The \\nbandwidth available increa ses with incre asing carrier f requency . Thus, generally  \\nspeaking the wider the bandwidth, the la rger the am ount of inf ormation which can be \\ncarried and the faster its speed. Therefore, we can provide a definition .to the concept \\nof frequenc y as under. \\nFrequency is the rate at w hich a wave or cy cle alternates betw een high and low \\n(analog m ode) or on an d off (digital m ode). For exam ple, the lowest buz notes \\nreproduced on a good stereo set may emanate a wav e pattern as slow as 30 times  \\n(cycles) per second, while very  high notes cau se wav e patterns to alternate as often as \\n20,000 tim es per second. \\nOne cy cle per second is called a Hertz (H Z). The enclosed table shows so me \\nfrequencies for telephone and other electronic transmission media. \\nElectronic T ransmis sion Frequenci es \\nMedia \\nSub-voice     30-30 0 Hz (Hertz) \\nVoice     300-3 000 Hz \\nHigh Fidelit y Equipm ent   3-30 KHz (Kilohertz) \\nRadio Broadcasting    30-30 00 KHz \\nTelevision Broadcasting   3-30 MHz (megahertz). \\nVHF Television     30-30 0MHz \\nUHF Television     300-3 000MH z \\nSatellite Co mmunication   3-30 GHz(gigahertz) \\nMicrowave communication   30-30 0 GHz \\nLasers, fiber optics   300 GHz Tern hertz Range \\nBandwidth \\nBandwidth is the second concept im portant for transm ission. This co ncept can be \\nexplained with the help of the traffic netw ork mentioned earlier. If there is a two-way  \\nstreet, consist ing of two single lanes, one in each direction, only  one line of vehicles \\ncan travel in each directio n. On a superhi ghwa y, however, there may be three or four \\nlanes in each direction; cars may travel along t hese lanes, in parallel, each at its own \\nrate of speed. We have a wider \\n  \\nInformation Technolog y: `band\\' of highway  which can acco mmodate more car s traveling in the sa me directi on \\nat the sa me time. In the sa me w ay, the width of the e lectronic path determ ines h ow \\nmany  cycles or bits can travel along th is given path  at any given  time; the more \\nbandwidth is available, the m ore bits may be transm itted, and the be tter the qualit y of \\ntransm ission. In a sim ple telephone conv ersation, we use a bandwidth of abo ut 3000 \\nbits per second or 3 KHz . Television need s more bandwidth to accommodate au dio \\nand visual signals, and uses approxi mately 4,500,000 Hz or 4.5 MHz. \\n42 Concept  and Basics \\n \\n \\nFrequencies and bandwid th occur from  low to  very high alon g a continuo us rang e of \\nfrequencies c alled the spec trum . To kee p transm ission from  interfe ring with one \\nanother, each type (voice, radio, television, satellites, etc.) is allocat ed a bandwidth in \\nthis spectru m. Allocation i s determ ined for an y natio n by its com munications \\ncommission and internatio nally by the International Teleco mmunications Union \\n(ITU) to avoi d com petition for the sam e bandwidths by different carriers and \\ncountries. \\nWhen bandwidths are allocated°, suffici ent extra space  is provided between \\nfrequencies t o prevent electronic interfere nce in so far as possible . This safety  \\nprecaution m ight not always work, when we hear or see overlap among radi o \\nbroadcasts or television progra ms. \\n3.3.4  Message Quality and  Quantity \\nQuality  of transm ission is a very  importa nt .consideration in telecommunication. \\nVoice co mmunication can  use a narrow bandw idth, which means the reproducti on of \\nsound is not of high fidelit y because the hum an ear i s adaptable and can discern \\nwords even if not entirely  faithfully  reproduced. The s ame is not true for the \\ntransm ission of m usic, where we expect high qualit y sound; f or television \\nbroadcasting, where our pi cture must be sharp and the  qualit y of col our hi gh; and  \\nespecially  for data trans mission, where inaccurate bit trans mission can result in \\ngarbled and worthless messages. \\nThere are many techniques, besides provid ing m ore bandwidth t han actually  need ed, \\nto im prove trans mission quality  and reduce the noise. One such tec hnique is \\nmultiplexing. Multiplexing is of two t ypes: Frequency Division Multiplexing, (F DM) \\nand Tim e Division Multipl exing (TDM). Fre quenc y Division Mul tiplexing is used to \\nsplit a channel into several discrete narro wer ones for si multaneous but separated \\ntransm ission. On the other hand, tim e division m ultiplexing uses a co mmon channel \\nfor several message s but at interm ittent ti mes; each si gnal taking turns on the same \\nchannel. In ot her words, multiplexing is a technique that is often us ed to interleave \\ndata so that they  can be carried m ore efficiently  in the same bandwidth. It is sim ilar \\nto concentrating but replaces many  lines w ith one trans mission path of .greater \\ncapacity . It must be rem embered that m ultiplexing is a sharing technique onl y. There \\nis no increase in the total inform ation than can be transmitted. \\nSelf Check E xercise \\n3) Explain the c oncept of frequenc y and bandwidth. \\n4) write short on  message qualit y and quant ity in telecomm unication. \\nNote:  i) Write your answer in the space given below \\nii) Check your answer with  the answers given at the e nd of this Unit. \\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …… \\n  \\nTelecom municat ion : Basics \\n3.4 COMMUNICATION CHANNELS  \\n43  \\n \\nA wire pair connecting tw o telephones is the sim plest circuit, allowing \\ncommunication in both directions. Other ch annels include coaxial cables, optical \\nfibres, satellit es, a light beam , microwaves, and others. Whatever the phy sical \\nmediu m over or through w hich m essage travels, trans mission may take place in a \\nnumber of different modes. They are : Sim plex, Half-duplex an d Full-duplex . \\nSimplex  In this t ype of channel, the messag e trav els in only  one direction, that \\n  is from  point A to point  B but n ot back again. \\nHalf-Duplex   Trans mission can take plac e in either direction, but not at the sa me \\n  time. In other words, message can be transm itted either fro m A to B \\n  or by  B to A one at a time.  \\nFull-Duplex  In this ty pe of arrangem ent messages can be transm itted and received \\n  over the sa me channel at the sa me ti me. \\nMany  librarians and inform ation scientists  are familiar with the latter two t ypes \\nbecause datab ase search ter minals must be set  to transmit full or hal f duplex i n order \\nto comm unicate with database vendors\\' com puters. \\n3.4.1 Synchronous and Asynchronous Transmission \\nAnother method of setting of term inals denotes sy nchronous or asynchronous \\ntransm ission. Many  terminals can only communicate in one or the o ther m ode. \\nAsynchronous trans mission is also known as \"start-s top\" transm ission. This m eans \\nthat every  transmitted character (or group of  characters) is defined by  a special \\ncharacter at the beginni ng and end den oting `begi nning\\' and tend\\' of that character.. \\nThus, the receiving term inal does not ha ve to operate \"in phase\" with each other and \\ntrans mission is interpreted or decoded at  the receiving ter minal exa ctly as it was \\nencoded b y the sender In other words, i n synchron ous communication data is sent \\nfrom  one machine to anot her in a con tinuous stream , the sending and receiving \\nequipm ent must be in step with each other throughout  the transm ission. This t ype of \\ntrans mission is used for high speed data  transm ission, generally  between two \\nmainframes. \\nAsynchronous form  of communication is used  by most inform ation system s attached \\nto the pu blic t elephone net work. \\n3.4.2 Moderns \\nAs it was explained earlier,  communicati ons channels can operate in either the \\nAnalog or di gital mode. However, a given circuit can operate onl y in one m ode not \\nboth of them  at the sa me time. Thus, ther e is need for translating from  one to the \\nother of the t wo modes. All voice comm unication o ccurs in the analog m ode; y et, \\nwhen we use voice-grade channels to trans mit data we need to comm unicate wit h the \\nreceiving or sending com puter in the digital mode. \\nModems are devices whic h function as \"trans lators\", changing the digital signals \\ncoming out of the term inal to analog so that it can travel along a v oice-grade channel. \\nAt the receivi ng end, there is another m odem, retransl ating the analog signal into the \\ndigital signal the com puter can accept M odem  stands, for m odulation-dem odulation. \\nSome modems are built into the term inal, while others are separ ate devices \\ninterposed between the terminal and the telephone lin e; \\nModems co me in a variety  of form s. They  are : acoustic coupler, stand-alone m odem s, \\nand internal modems. Mo dems are sometimes referr ed to as V22, V32, etc. The V \\nnumbers are series of standards defined by  Consultati ve Committee for International \\nTelegraphy  and Telepho nes (CCITT), some of which are su mmerised below: \\n  \\nInformation Technolog y: V2I 300bps full-duplex asynchro nous  \\nV22 1200bps full-duplex asynchro nous  \\nV22 bis 2400 bps full-duplex asynchro nous  \\nV23 200/75bps full-duplex asynchro nous  \\nV26 2400.1bps full-duplex asynchro nous  \\nV27ter 4800bps full-duplex asynchro nous  \\nV29 9600bps full-duplex asynchro nous  \\nV32 9600bps full-duplex asynchro nous  \\nV2142 Recent standard includi ng error correction protocols \\n44 Concept  and Basics \\n \\n \\nSelf Check E xercise \\n5) Explain the d ifference between Sim plex , Half – Du plex and Ful l- Duplex \\nmodes of transm ission . \\n6) What is the di fference between sy nchro nous and as ynchronous tran smission \\n7) What is meant by the acrony m modem?

The \"commo nly used perf ormance measurem ent of a \\nteleco mmunications link is  its bandwidth . This gives an indication of the range o f \\nfrequencies which can be transm itted by  these channel s. The greater  the bandwidth, the \\ngreater the rat e at which data can be transmitted. \\nThe channels or media can be grouped  into two m ain divisions, i.e., line and\\'  free \\nspace. In the line group, we have two meta llic media, t wisted pairs and coaxial cables \\nand one optical medium - glass or optical fibres. In the free spac e category , we have \\nradio propaga tion which includes broadcast (e.g., TV) and point to point (e.g., \\nmicrowave signals). Let us discuss these  in a greater detail. \\n3.5.1 Tw isted Pairs \\nTwisted pairs are fam iliar to all of us as the copper wire telephone lines. These ar e of low \\nfrequency , and supp ort a li mited ba ndwidth (o ne voic e channel) bu t can also be used for data \\ncommunication at the low er speeds of 300bps. F or higher speed or rates of data transfer, \\n  \\nTelecom municat ion : Basics 4-wire leas ed lines may be used. The pr oblem s associated with this kind of \\ntrans mission are: noise on the line, parity erro rs and so on.  Twisted pairs are used for \\nconventional voice telepho ne and telex services. \\n45  \\n \\n3.5.2  Coaxial Cables \\nAnother metallic transm ission m edium which offers a large bandwidth, is the coaxial \\ncable. Such cables consist of an outer pr otective shell made of copper tube, less than \\none inch in dia meter, whic h actually  carries messages. There are tw o types of coa xial \\ncables- the ba se band and the broad band. Base band cables use di gital trans mission \\nand are suitable for fairly  short distances. These have a data rate of about 50 Mb/ s in \\nhalf-duplex mode. Broad band coaxial cable on the o ther hand, is more fam iliar as \\nCATV and is suitable for l ong distance (up to 15 KM ) transm ission. It can supp ort \\ndata rates of over 100 Mb/s. Coaxial ca bles, with their better elect rical properties, can \\ntrans mit at much higher frequencies an d support wider bandwidth than the twisted \\npairs. They  are suitable, therefore, for hi gh qualit y bul k transm ission of data at hig h \\nspeeds as well as text, picture and voice . For exam ple, one such cable can suppo rt the \\nequivalent of up to 10800 telephone (voi ce) channels. \\n3.5.3 Optical Fibr es \\nCoaxial cable s have li mitations such as broadband tra nsmission medium  which can \\nbe overcome b y the use of optical fi bres. Optical fibres carry  light waves \\n(representing electric al impales) by  the principle of internal reflectio n. These fibres \\ncarry  signals in the form  of light, an d hence can carry  large volum es of data at high \\nspeed, and are resist ant to interference. Thus , they are `clear er\\' lines with less n oise. \\nThoug h the y were expensive when first in troduced, but nowada ys costs hive fallen to \\nsuch a level that the y are being used by  some organisations for their local area \\nnetworks. \\n3.5.4  Microwave Transm ission \\nUsing space a s trans mission m edium, microwave e manates fro m an origination point \\non earth, such  as telephone exchange, wher e many  individual m essages have been \\nconcentrated. Becaus e the microwave b eam travels i n a straight line, it is \\nadvantageous to place m icrowave towers  on hil ls or mountains to minim ise \\ninterference from  land mass. Us ually , towers ar e plac ed between 25 to 30 m iles apart \\nto remain in sight of each other (`line-o f-sight\\'). Microwave trans mission can carr y \\n600 t o 1800 voice channels. Advantages of m icrowave transm ission include lower \\ncost than coaxial cable, where right-of-way  must be obtained and higher costs are  \\nincurred when the phy sical cable is laid over long distances. A s with other s ystems \\nthat trans mit through free space the signals ar e subjec t to fading caused by  absorption \\nand scattering from  moisture and precipitation in  the air. In other words, at mospheric \\ninterference i s greater and rain can caus e. sever e trans mission proble ms. \\nThe great advantage is that the m icrowav e transm ission is a broad band facility  able \\nto carry  several thousand c hannels. It is suitable for b ulk transm ission data over long \\ndistances. \\n3.5.5 Satellite Transmission \\nSatellites use microwave frequencies an d techniques. Satellites used for m essage \\ntransm ission (as opposed t o those, whic h travel aroun d the earth on  strategic and \\nmeteorological missions) rem ain in constant  position i n relation to a  fixed location on \\nearth; they  are said to be in a geostationaty  orbit. This position allows the satellit e to \\nof data  over a long distance. \\nUsed e xtensively for gene ral telecom munications, as  well as for te levis ion, \\nsatellites we re originally c ontem plated only for long di stance transworld links but \\nare now  incre asingly employed for high speed; high volum e transfer for exam ple \\ndocument delivery, elec tronic publishing. In some countries  like India, satellite s are \\nused instea d of unde rground cables bec ause of  the high cost of installing the latter. \\n  \\nInformation Technolog y: 3.5.6  Choice of Medium  \\n46 Concept  and Basics \\n \\n All the transmission channels discusse d in the foregoing paragraphs can be used as \\npoint to point connections or as broadcast sy stems. Transm itting information \\nelectronically  or ph otonical ly is consider ed in two aspects - tele communications and \\nbroadcasting. The form er is a direct inte rchange of in formati on within lim ited groups \\nof talkers and listeners (wh ich may  be te rminals of com puter s as w ell as people). \\nThus, there is a certain amount of interacti on. Broadcasting is the mass distribution of \\ninform ation to large markets with one `s peaker\\'  and many  \"listeners\\'  and no real \\ninteraction. \\nBecause of the increasing linking up of the two form s with com puters, the traditional \\ndistinction is being bl urred and now you get sy stem s like electronic mail, which can \\neither he broadcast of telec ommunication and cable TV broadcasting sy stem s which \\ncarry  teleco mmunications. And an y given transm ission circuit coul d be m ade up  of a \\nmixture of terrestial microwaves, cable a nd satellite links. Thus, a given service could \\nbe transm itted over m ore than one of channe l. For exam ple, a telev ision program can \\nbe broadcast let us say  normally  - as you get it at home via sat ellite or via broa dband \\ncoaxial cable using radio fr equency . \\nThe decision on which m edium  to use is de termined by factors such as the distance \\ninvolved , the area to be covered and the type  of inf ormation to be sent. For exam ple, \\nterrestial microwave radio trans mission re quires line-of-sight communication and  for \\nlong distances repeater s must be added. If the medium  has to acco mmodate video or \\nhigh speed da ta then a broad bandwidt h such as is provided by satellite and coaxial, \\nfibre optical cables will be required. \\n3.6 SWITCHING MECHANISMS \\nSwitching m echanism s are techniques devised  to send messages in many  dinections \\nat once and to ensure that these mess ages are re ceived  with a m inimum of delay. In \\nother words, if a bottleneck or queue occ urs in m essage traffic, by passes or altern ate \\npaths to the d estination are provi ded b y taking recourse to switching m echanisms. \\nIf traffic betw een two exchanges is too h eavy , an alternate path is chosen. These \\nexchanges perform  the switching fu nctio n for the telep hone s ystem . Switching is \\ncarried out by com puters in  most cases. Computers al so serve to concentrate (col lect) \\nmessages for transm ission over hig her capacity  lines. The lines used in the telep hone \\nnetwork are wires, coaxial  cables, microwave and sat ellite links. \\nThe different techniques relating to switching m echani sms are discu ssed below. \\n3.6.1 Circuit Switching \\nMany  switching techniques are in use. One of them  is line or circuit switching in \\nwhich a co mmunications path is actually established before the me ssage is a ccepted \\nfor trans mission. For voice communicati on circuit switching is the norm  wher e by a \\npath thro ugh connected circuits is estab lished. While t his method is suited to \\ntelephone traffic, it is not s o, econom ical or efficient for data which is transm itted at \\ndifferent bit r ates and in vary ing am ounts. \\n3.6.2  Message Switching \\nThis is a different technique associ ated with  switching. According to this m ethod, the \\nsystem  accepts all message s, stores the m in a com puter, and transm its them as an d \\nwhen channels beco me available, \\n3.6.3  Packet Switching \\nThis is one of recent techniques of sw itching. Packet s witching was originally  \\ndeveloped for  use b y ARPA network b y the Defence Department of US. According \\nto this m ethod, each message is broken i nto packets of approsimately 1000 bi ts each. \\nEach packet carries information about its origin and destination Packets are store d \\nand forwarded by  means of co mputers in a steady  strea m, but not in any  order. \\nSpecially  designed com puters sort out \\n  \\nTelecom municat ion : Basics the packets at  each node in the transm ission network a nd retransm it them  along the \\nbest path to their destination, where they  are put in t he right sequence for decoding. \\nBecaus e of the standard siz e of packets,  trans mission is highly  efficient and less \\nprone to error . As a result, econom ies are e ffected which benefit th e end user. -Packet \\nswitching is the technolog y used in value-added networks like T ymnet and Telenet, \\nwhich provide libraries wit h connections  to m any database se arch s ervices. \\n47  \\n \\nThe advantages of packet switching incl ude transm ission econom ies because of \\nshared utilization, high quality, error re duced service, and the facilities for speed \\nchanging and  procedures conversion t hus allowing communication between different \\ntypes of term inals and the i nterconnection of networks . \\nSelf Check E xercise \\n8) Discuss briefl y the different ty pes of trans mission media. \\n9) Explain the meaning of th e term  ‘Switching Mechani sm’ and m ention the \\nadvantages of ‘packet switc hing’ . \\nNote:  i) Write your answer in the space given below \\nii) Check your answer with  the answers given at the e nd of this Unit. \\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… ……\\n………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …………… …… \\n3.7 NETW ORKING AND TELECOMM UNICATI ONS \\nComputers ca n now communicate with each other and with a range of peripheral \\ndevices, over distances wit h increasing speed and reliability . Technological adva nces \\nin worldwide communications have ush ered in a new era not onl y of com puting \\npower but also of access to  inform ation services at _least in those countries which \\nhave been able to develop e xtensiv e and reliable telep hone network s. The \\ntransm ission over telephon e network, no t only of voice, but m ore recently  also of  text \\nand illustration through tele facsi mile, lai d the foundati ons for this a ge in which \\ncommunication is taken fo r granted in d eveloped cou ntries. Predictions m ade earlier, \\nthat rapid gro wth in com puter networking would be th e em phasis of the .1990s seem  \\nto be bor ne out in the developm ents of networks at local, regional, national and \\nglobal levels. Some of the d evelopments ar e discuss ed in the following paragraphs. \\n3.7.1  Networks \\nThere are different interpretations for the  term °nets% The Oxford E nglish Dictionary  \\nstates that `a network is an interconnected chain or s ystem of imma terial things\". On \\nthe other hand, the National Co mmission on Li braries and Inform ation Science \\n(NCLIS) USA defines network as: \"Two or more libraries and/or other organisations \\nengaged in a common pattern of inform ation exchang e, throug h communications, for \\nsome functional purp ose. A network usually  consists of a form al arrangem ent \\nwhereby  materials, infor mation and services provided by  a variety of ty pes of \\nlibraries and/or other or ganisations are made availabl e to all potential users. Libraries \\nmay be in different jurisdictions but  agree to serve one another on the sa me basis as \\neach servic es its own constituents. Com puters and teleco mmunicati ons m ay be \\namong the tools used for f acilitating co mmunications am ong them \". (ALA Year \\nBook, 1 976, p. 24 8). \\n  \\nInformation Technolog y: UNISIST II working d ocument defines Inform ation Network as : \"A set of \\ninterrelated information sy stems associat ed with comm unications facilities, which are \\noperating though m ore or less for mal agre ements and institutional a rrangem ent in \\norder to joi ntly implement inform ation handling operation with a vi ew to poolin g \\ntheir resource s and to offer better service s to user. They generally follow identical or \\ncompatible procedures.\" (UNISIST II). \\n48 Concept  and Basics \\n \\n \\n3.7.2  Types of Networking \\nThere are thr ee ty pes of ne tworking, which may be said to have considerable i mpact \\non library  and inform ation services. The y are: co mmunication networks, com puter \\nnetworks and inform ation ne tworks. Although as infor mation professionals, we are to \\nunderstand the functioning of each of these ty pes, in the context of t his Unit, we shall \\nlimit our discussion m ainly to comm unication networks. \\nCommuni cation Network s \\nCommunication networks are made up of tran smission lines, conc entrators, swi tching \\nmechanisms and non- data processing com pone nts. Due to increased com petition in \\nthe communication industr y, new and sp ecialised co mmon carriers and value-added \\nnetworks with data processing equipm ent, is also linked to communication networks. \\nThe current technological trend setter in  communications is \"packet switching \\ntechnolog y\". The greatest advantage of packet  switch ed networks is in applications \\nwhere the distance involve d is great. Inf ormation services involve relatively  large \\nquantities of data for full bibliographic or full text retr ieval, and the refore, the \\ndistance adva ntage applies m ore clearly to these applications. Depending upon the  \\narea of ad ministrative jurisdiction, networks  fall into three categori es: Local Are a \\nNetworks (L ANs), Metro politan Area Netw orks and Wide Area Networks (WANs). \\nLocal Area Network s (LANs) \\nA Local Area Network connects a large number of different ty pes o f equipm ent, \\nincluding com puter ter minals, fax, telex, CD ROM play ers, etc., on a single site. The \\nmajority  of L ANs use packet switching t echnolog y and offer ver y high transm ission \\nspeeds - up to  one hu ndred times faster than those available on pu blic networks at \\npresent. Most of these are baseband that is they carry  only digital c omputer data,  but \\nbroadband L ANs can carry video an d voice si gnals as well as dat a. The topology of \\nLANs can vary  greatly (i.e., linear, star, ring) affecting efficiency , reliability and \\ncosts. \\nMetropolitan Area Networks \\nThese ty pe of  networks generally  cover specific metropolitan area and provide t o \\nthem all the s ervices. \\nWide Ar ea Network s (WANs ) \\nWide Area N etworks (WA Ns) are privat e networks linking equipm ent at several \\ndifferent sites and have m uch in comm on -with conve ntional large scale dat a \\nnetworks. \\nIn configuri ng a network t o comm unicate inform ation the focus is on m inimising \\ncosts while maintaining the  desired perform ance (or minim um desired qualit y) \\nstandards depend on the nature of the info rmation to be sent. In the case of voice,  \\nqualit y is m easured by word intelligibili ty or articulation index. For video, t he \\nTelevision Allocations Stu dy Organisati on has adopte d the TASO grades ranging \\nfrom  excellen t to poor that specify  the degree of subjective acceptabilit y of the \\npicture display ed to viewing audiences. For bot h voic e and video, t he corresponding \\nquantified m easure of quality, signal-to- noise ratio, is used as a technical design \\nparam eter. For digital inf ormation, say  from one co mputer to the ot her the qualit y of \\nthe trans mission is expressed as the number of bit `errors\\', a appeari ng as \\'0\\' or vice \\nversa, that occur as a fracti on of the total num ber of bits sent. \\nAlong with perfor mance requirements, it is necessary  to choose the channel \\nbandwidth for analog transmission. The trans mission speed of digit al signals is also \\nreferred to as data rate or bit rate. These f actors partly  deter mine co at. Therefore, \\ndepending  on whether the \\n  \\nTelecom municat ion : Basics transm ission is from  one point to  anothe r, one po int to several, or several points to a \\ncentral point, a network is designed. Th e sim plest `network\\'  might involve j ust two \\nstations (point to point) li nked for exampl e, to transfer data from  one com puter t o \\nanother, or it might be a com plicated sy stem wher e several stations are connected  to a \\nlocal node, several local nodes connected to a central node, and so  on in hierarchical \\nfashion. \\n49  \\n \\nDevelop ments in network t echnology incl ude the increasing use of co mputers to \\ncontrol switching an d info rmation flow, m ost significant is the m odernisation of  the \\npublic networ k so that v oice and data can be  carried over a single network. This t ype \\nof single network is referr ed to as an Integrated Services Digital N etwork (ISDN). \\n3.7.3 Open Syste ms Int ercon nection (OS1) \\nAs there are many  different prot ocols for LANs and WANs, co mmunication b etween \\ntwo different sy stems can be difficult. The International Standards Organisation. \\n(ISO) has attem pted with some success t o solve the pr oblem  by the introducti on of \\nOpen \\' Systems Interconnection (OSI). OSI defines a s et of procedures and standards \\ngrouped into seven lay ers, for the exchange  of inf ormation between term inals an d \\ncomputers. \\nIn theor y all s ystem s which  conform  to OSI specifications shoul d be able to \\ninterconnect, but the definitions are vague  in certain areas and incom patibilities do \\narise. To overco me this, some countries have develop ed thei r own more detailed  \\nstandards. \\nAnyone invol ved in the purchase of equipmen t which is to be linke d to a networ k \\nshould fi nd out whether th ere are any industr y specific GOSIPS (Governm ent OSI \\nProfiles) to which the y must conform . \\n3.8 TELECOMMUNI CATIONS STANDARDS  AND \\nPROTOCOLS  \\nStandards .are very  important in the te lecommunicati ons area if data is to be \\ntransm itted successfully  between differ ent equipm ent manufactured by  different \\nfirms. , \\n3.8.1  Standards \\nThey  are defi ned internationally by  the CCITT (Consultative Committee for \\nInternational Telegraphy  and Telepho nes), but to deal with the rapi dly changi ng \\nteleco mmunications needs  of the EEC, the European Teleco mmunications Standards \\nInstitute (ETSI) has been set up. The ET SI is responsible for defini ng standards for \\nservices and equipm ent sp ecially  for the  networks of t he EEC member countries. \\nExamples of standards are the X.25 standard  for pack et switched networks, the RS \\n232 i nterface,  and the V series for modems. In addition to these offi cial standards, \\nthere are a num ber of de facto standards such as, the MNP error correction protocols \\nfor m odems, which -have b een developed indepen dently b y manufacturers and \\nbecame widel y used. \\nIn order to ensure that equipment that is to  be connect ed to the p ublic network is safe \\nand does not  interfere with the norm al operati on of the network, it must be approv ed \\nby the appr opriate regulatory  body. \\nEquipm ent that has been a pproved carries s ticker wit h a green circle and the word \\n`approved\\'  on it. \\n3.8.2  Protocols \\nThe two major co mponents relating to a WAN are the Protocol and the Media. The \\nmedia are the actual path way s that the protocol travel s on. The net work protoco l \\ndefines the for mat in. which da ta are sen t through the media. \\nProtocols are rules governi ng the initiation and *maintenance of data flows. Thes e are \\nimplem ented in different way s for diffe rent t ypes of equipm ent and networks. \\nInform ation professionals are most likely to encounter these when setting up their \\nsat-wa re and hardware \\n  \\nInformation Technolog y: \\n50 Concept  and Basics \\n \\n • \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• \\n• for onli ne searching. In suc h situations, a ll should  deal with such pa rameters as: \\nbit rate \\nparity  \\nstop bits \\nflow control \\nechoplex \\nduplex \\nBesides the above, ot her important parame ters are word lengt h used, and wheth er \\ntransm ission is sy nchronous or asynchronous. T he significance of these paramet ers is \\nsummarised below \\nLine bit rate  is measured in bits per second (b ps) and  also referred to as baud rate. \\nThe speed at which data ca n be transm itted is deter mined by  the service being \\naccessed, and the quality  and characteris tics of the teleco mmunications link. \\nParity:  The p arity bit is a rudim entary  form  of error checking which can be \\nemployed wh en a word length of 7 bits i s in use. The full range of values is: odd , \\neven, ignore; mark (alway s set to 1); no ne (word lengt h of bits i n use). \\nIf odd parity is selected the co mputer assi gns a value to the parit y bit so that the \\nnumbers of `1\\' bits in each character is o dd, for ev en parity , the parity is set so that \\nthe num ber of bits is even. \\nStop bits:  These ar e a means of keeping the transm itting and receiving com puters in \\nstep with one another.

The \\ndevelopm ents in telecommunications over the past tw o decades ha ve paved the \\nway to the growth of com puter-based library  and information sy stems and \\nservices. \\nData Co mmu nications\\' , `Communications Technolog y\\', `Com puter \\nTeleco mmunications\\'  `Compunications\\' , `Teleco mputing\\', etc., are ju st some of \\nthe ter ms used to describe a process, that of transm itting a m essage from  one \\npoint to another by electronic means, and the devices used to achieve this \\nprocess. The process is well known and we engage \\n  \\nInformation Technolog y: in this process daily  as we speak to one another. We call this the communications \\nprocess. Ther efore, teleco mmunications is the transmission of representations of \\ninform ation between remot e locations by electronic means. This information may \\nbe in the for m of voice, video, or data g enerated by  a computer. \\n52 Concept  and Basics \\n \\n \\n2) A sim ple teleco mmunications networ k consists of the following f unctional \\ncomponents: i) a transm ission network,  ii) an arrangement of transmission paths, iii) \\nswitching centres through which signals are convey ed by a ph ysical mediu m. For \\nexam ple, infor mation co ming from  a source, or to a receiver is converted via a ter minal \\ninto signals a ppropriate to the characteri stics of the particular network. For i nstance, in \\nthe standard voice telephone network sy stem , the changes in air pressure at the \\nmicropone are represented by a corresponding vari ation in electrical  voltage. This  is an \\nexam ple of analogue signa l. In contrast, computer sy stems generate digital signal s, \\nwhich are rep resented as o ne of two dis crete st ates, n amely, on or off (1, or 0). \\n3) Frequency  and bandwidt h are two basic components which enable us to un derstand h ow \\ninform ation is transm itted. The inform ation which m ay in the f orm of sound (human \\nvoice) or m ay be visual (pri nted page, vi deo pi cture) must be converted to electric signals \\n(electro magnetic waves) before it can  be transm itted over a given mediu m. \\nFrequency  is the rate at wh ich a wave or cy cle alternates between high and l ow \\n(analog m ode) or on an d off (digital m ode). For exam ple, the lowest buz notes \\nreproduced on a good stereo set may estimate a wave pattern as slow as 30 times  \\n(cycles) per second, while very  high notes cau se wav e patterns to alternate as often as \\n20,000 tim es per second. One cy cle per second is called a Hertz (Hz). \\nBandwidth is another im portant concept for tr ansm ission. This co ncept can be un derstood \\neasily  if we take the analogy of traffic networ k. For exa mple, if there is a two wa y street, \\nconsisting two single lanes,.one in each direc tion, only one line of vehicles can t ravel in \\neach directio n. On a superhighwa y, however, there may be three or four lanes in each \\ndirection; cars may travel along t hese lanes, in parallel, each at its own rate of speed. \\nSimilarly, if we have a wi der band highwa y which can acco mmodate more car s travelling \\nin the sa me direction at the sa me \\'time. In the sa me way, the width of an electronic path \\ndeterm ines \\'how many  cycles or bits can trav el along t his given pat h\\' at any  given tim e. \\nTherefore, the more bandwidth is available,  the m ore bits may be transm itted, and the \\nbetter will be the qualit y of transm ission. Frequency  and bandwidt h occur from  low to \\nvery high along a range of frequencies, called  the spec trum . To kee p transm ission from  \\ninterfering with one another, each ty pe (voice, radio, television, satellites, etc.) is \\nallocated a ba ndwidth in this spectru m. \\n4) Quality  of transm ission is very  important consideration in telecomm unication.. \\'Voice \\ncommunication can use a marrow bandwidth, which means that th e reproductio n of \\nsound is not of high fidelit y because, the hum an ear i s adaptable and can discern \\nwords even if not entirely  faithfully  reproduced. The s ame is\\' not true, for the \\ntransm ission of m usic, where we expect high qualit y sound, f or television \\nbroadcasting where our picture m ust be shar p and the qualit y of col our hi gh, this is \\nspecially  so in data trans mission, wher e inaccurate bit trans mission can result in \\nworthless m essages and poor quality  trans mission. \\nBetter quality transm ission can be achieved by different techniques besides provi ding \\nmore bandwidth. One such technique is multiplexing. Multiplexing is of two t ypes: \\nfrequency  division m ultiplexing (FDM) a nd tim e division m ultiplexing. FDM is used \\nto split a channel into several discrete narrower ones for sim ultaneo us but, separate \\ntrans mission. On the other hand, TDM uses a co mmo n channel for several messages \\nbut at interm ittent tim es. Multiplexing is a sharing technique used to im prove the \\nqualit y of transm ission. \\n5) Simplex, Half duplex an d Full-dup lex are the different m odes in which transmission \\ntakes place w henever message travels over or through a phy sical medium . \\nIn sim plex ch annel, the m essage travel s in only one direction. That is to say  if A \\nand B are two points i nvolved in transm ission process, the message travels fro m \\nA to B and not back again. \\nOn the other hand in half-duplex m ode, transm ission can take place in either \\ndirection (i.e. , A to B and B to A) but o ne at a tim e. \\n  \\nTelecom municat ion : Basics In case of full-duplex m ode the transm ission as well as reception of messages can \\ntake place bet ween A and B at the sa me time. Librarians require the latter two \\ntypes namely  half-duplex a nd full- duple x modes because database search \\nterminals must be set eithe r in half-dup lex or in fu ll-duplex m ode in order to \\ncommunicat e with database vendors\\'  computer s. \\n53  \\n \\n6) Term inals can be set to transm it in two way s: synchr onous m ode and asynchron ous \\nmode. Many  terminals c an communicat e in one or the other of these m odes. \\nAsynchronous trans mission is also known as start-st op transm ission. This m eans \\nthat every  transmitted character (or group of  characters) is defined by  a special \\ncharacter at the beginni ng and end den oting begi nning and end of transm ission. \\nThus, the receiving term inal does not ha ve to operate in phase with each other \\nand transm ission Is interpreted or decoded at the recei ving term inal exactly  as it \\nwas encoded by the sender.  In synchro nous communication data is sent from  one \\nmachine to a nother in a continuous st ream , the s ending and receiving equipm ent \\nmust be in step, to each other throughout  the transm ission. This t ype of \\ntrans mission is used for high speed data  transm ission, generally  between two \\nmainframe co mputers. On the other hand  asynchro nous form  of communication \\nis used b y most inform ation system s attached to publ ic telephone network, \\n7) Communications channels can operate in analog or digital m ode. It may  be stated \\nthat a given c ircuit can operate onl y in one of the m odes and not in both of them  \\nat the sa me time. Therefor e, there is a need for translating from  one to the other \\nof these modes. \\n\\'Mode ms\\' are devices whic h function as translators, c hanging the digital signals \\ncoming out of the ter minal to analog so that these signals could travel along a \\nvoice grade channel. At the receiving end there is another m odem which \\nretranslate s the analog signals into digita l signals which the com puter can ac cept. \\nModem  stands for m odulation and demodulation.  Modems are available in \\nvariety  of forms. They  are: acoustic . coupler, stand alone m odems and internal \\nmodems. They are appropr iately  used in  different situations. \\n8) By transm ission m edia, we usuall y mean a mix of ph ysical lines ran ging from  wire \\npairs to cable, and over the air transm ission m edia, such as microwave and satellites. \\nThe transm ission m edia used in tel ecomm unications networks vary bot h \\nphysically and in their carry ing capaci ty. The comm only used performance \\nmeasurement of a teleco mmunications li nk is its ban dwidth. Th is gives an \\nindication of the range of f requencies which can be transm itted 15y the channel.  \\nThe channels or media can be grouped  into two m ain divisions: line and free \\nspace. In the line group we have two me tallic media n amely twisted pairs and \\ncoaxial cable s and one optical medium, i.e.` glass or \\'optical fibres. In the free \\nspace c ategory, we have radio propaga tion which includes broadcast(e.g., TV) \\nand poi nt to point (e.g.,m icrowave signals) \\n9) Switching m echanism s-are techniques devi sed to send messages in many  directions \\nat the sa me time and to ensure that these mes sages are received with  a minimum \\ndelay . In other words, if a bottleneck or  queue occurs in m essage traffic, then \\nbypasses or a lternate paths to the destina tion are provided taking re course to \\nswitching me chanis m. There are: i) circ uit switching, ii) mess age s witching, and Hi) \\npacket-switch ing. Of these three, packet switching is one of the recent techniques. \\nThis was originall y develo ped for use b y ARPA network. The ad vantages of p acket \\nswitching include transm ission econom ies because of shared utilization, high quality \\ntransm ission, error reduced service, a nd the facilities for speed changing and \\nprocedures conversion, ther eby allowing communication between d ifferent ty pes of \\nterminals and  the interconn ection of net works. \\n10) Computers ca n now communicate with each  other and with a range of peripheral \\ndevices, over distances wit h great speed and reliabilit y. Technologic al- advances \\nin worldwide communications have ush ered in a new era of co mputing p ow.er \\nand acces s, to inform ation services and have b een able to develop e xtensive and \\nreliable telep hone network s. The transmi ssion over telephone networks of v oice, \\ntext and illustrations through facsi mile laid the foundations for the development \\nof networks at local, region al, national and gl obal lev els. \\n  \\nInformation Technolog y: Communication networks are made up of  transm ission lines, conc entrators, \\nswitching mechanism s and non-data pr ocessing co mponents. Due t o increased \\ncompetition i n the comm unication industry , new and specialised common \\ncarrier s and value-added networks with da ta processin g equipm ent, is also linked \\nto comm unication network s. \\n54 Concept  and Basics \\n \\n \\nA local area n etwork (LAN) connects a large num ber of different t ypes of \\nequipm ent, including com puter term inals, fax, telex on  a single site. Most of \\nthese are ba seband that is to say  that the y carry  only digital com puter data. LAN s \\ncan also carry  video and  voice signals. The topol ogy of LANs can vary  greatl y \\n(i.e., linear, star and ring) a ffecting effici ency , reliability and costs. \\nWide area net works (WAN s) are private networks linking equipm ent at several \\ndifferent sites.
